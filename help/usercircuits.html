        This application wouldn't be much useful if it didn't allow for
        saving and loading user circuits.<br />
        The saving and loading is done in the File menu.<br />
        Once a circuit is saved, it appears in the 
        <a href="toolbox.html">toolbox</a><p/> and can be used in a bigger
        circuit, just like any basic gate.
