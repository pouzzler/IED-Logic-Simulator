        <h2>IED Logic Simulator User Manual</h2>
        <p/>
        This user manual describes the various elements of the IED 
        Logic Simulator's (IEDLS) user interface, and their interaction.
        <p/>
        The IELDS is a logic circuit simulator with which the user can 
        build and simulate gate-based logic circuits.
        <p/>
        The construction is done by dragging 
        <a href="basicgates.html">basic gates</a> and I/O from the 
        <a href="toolbox.html">toolbox</a> widget to the main area of 
        the program's interface, optionally modifying some of their 
        characteristics using the 
        <a href="tooloptions.html">tool options</a> widget or the 
        <a href="contextmenu.html">contextual right-click menu</a> and 
        connecting them together using the mouse in the main area.
        <p/>
        The simulation consists in setting the circuit's inputs (for 
        example with the contextual menu), and in watching the circuit's 
        internals and outputs evolve according to the rules of boolean 
        logic.
