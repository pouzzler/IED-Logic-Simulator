        <h2>Main Area</h2>
        <p/>
        In order to create a circuit, one must add 
        <a href="usercircuits.html">user circuits</a> , 
        <a href="basicgates.html">basic gates</a>, 
        <a href="io.html">inputs and outputs</a> to the main area by 
        dragging and dropping them from the <a href="toolbox.html">toolbox</a>.
        <p/>
        One can then connect these elements one to the other by moving 
        the cursor above their connection pins, represented by small 
        circles, until the cursor shape changes to that of an upward 
        black arrow, and then dragging the cursor to another connection 
        pin until it once again changes to a black arrow; releasing the 
        mouse button at this point will generate a connection between 
        these two pins.
        <p/>
        A context menu is also available by right-clicking on items :
        <p/> 
        Every item can be named, by right-clicking into the bulk of its 
        representation, choosing "Set name" and giving a name in the 
        dialog that pops-up.
        <p/>
        Circuits and gates' input and output pins can also be given a 
        specific name by getting the context menu on that specific pin, 
        where the cursor changes shapes.
        <p/>
        Global input pins also have another option in the contextual 
        menu : False, or True. Clicking that option toggles it between 
        False and True.
