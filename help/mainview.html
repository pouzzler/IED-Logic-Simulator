        <h2>Main Area</h2>
        <p/>
        In order to create a circuit, one must add 
        <a href="usercircuits.html">user circuits</a> , 
        <a href="basicgates.html">basic gates</a>, 
        <a href="io.html">inputs and outputs</a> to the main area by 
        dragging and dropping them from the <a href="toolbox.html">toolbox</a>.
        <p/>
        Connexions are pretty intuitive : one can move the mouse over a
        connexion pin (represented by a small line and circle) until the
        cursor changes shape, then click and drag the mouse to draw a
        segment. This process can be repeated any number of times in order
        to draw paths from individual segments.
        <p/>
        Joining any segment to another connexion pin will generate a wire
        (when the connexion is valid) linking these two pins.
        <p/>
        It is also possible to join a segment to a preexisting wire.
        <p/>
        Setting an input pin's value is done by alt-clicking it.
