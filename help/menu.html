        <h2>Menu</h2>
        <p/>
        The menus are straightforward and don't need much explanation:
        <p />
        The file menu allows saving and loading circuits, as well as
        quitting the application.
        <p />
        The language menu allows choosing the user interface tongue
        (needs relaunching the application).
        <p />
        The help menu proposes an about dialog, as well as inline help
        pages.
        <p />
        Lastly, the edit menu allows toggling the logs dock on and off,
        clearing the contents of the main area, clearing the logs, and
        two experimental functionalities: <br />
        Add IOs tries to add as many inputs and outputs as are still 
        needed to complete a circuit. (ie. if you add a NOT gate to the
        main area, then use this option, it will add one input and one
        output). <br />
        Batch rename is used to name a quantity of inputs or outputs at
        once. It could be used in an 8-bit adder as follows : add 8 inputs
        for the first number, select them all, click batch rename, and propose
        "A" - they will now be named A0 to A7, do the same for the second number,
        propose "B", and have them now named B0 to B7.
        <p />
        The last entry in the edit menu is "Settings", which allows the user
        to choose the clock speed, verbosity options and interface colors.
